The TorQ-FX pack has been built to demonstrate an example of one type of system that can be built on top of the TorQ framework. This pack will build and maintain an FX database using data from [GAIN capital](http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/).

FX data consisting of bid and ask prices stretching back over 15 years, with data for more than 70 currency pairs becoming available each week. This is automatically downloaded and added to the database.
A user can then query the data through a gateway against the 3 HDB processes.

Please note that this pack runs on Linux only and requires kdb+ version 3.4, release date 2016.05.12 or later.
